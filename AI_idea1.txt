Is it possible to develop an AI model for my song website where as soon as I upload a song on my mongodb that song must be able to be displayed on specific folder which it belongs to i.e if I upload a kannada song it must be displayed in kannada language folder in my website - w.r.t my previous conversation
Yes, it is definitely possible to develop an AI model that can categorize songs into specific language folders automatically when you upload them to your MongoDB. Hereâ€™s a high-level overview of how you could approach this:

Steps to Implement the AI Model for Categorization
Data Collection and Preparation:

Collect a dataset of songs that are already categorized by language.

Extract features from these songs. Features could include audio features like Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs), chroma features, or lyrics (if available).

Model Training:

Train a machine learning model to classify songs based on these features.

Popular algorithms for this type of classification include Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, or neural networks if you have a large dataset.

Integration with Your Application:

Once the model is trained, integrate it into your backend. When a new song is uploaded, extract its features and use the model to predict its language.

Save the song metadata, including its predicted language, to MongoDB.

Updating the Frontend:

Modify your frontend to dynamically display songs based on their language. When fetching songs from MongoDB, filter them by the predicted language.

Technical Breakdown
1. Feature Extraction:

Use a library like librosa in Python to extract audio features.
import librosa

def extract_features(file_path):
    y, sr = librosa.load(file_path)
    mfccs = librosa.feature.mfcc(y=y, sr=sr, n_mfcc=13)
    return mfccs.mean(axis=1)


Model Training:

Use a machine learning library like scikit-learn to train your model.
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
import numpy as np

# Assuming you have a dataset with features and labels
features = np.array([...])  # Extracted features
labels = np.array([...])  # Corresponding language labels

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(features, labels, test_size=0.2)

model = RandomForestClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Save the model
import joblib
joblib.dump(model, 'language_model.pkl')

Integration with Backend:
Use the trained model to predict the language when a new song is uploaded.
from flask import Flask, request
import joblib
import librosa
import pymongo

app = Flask(__name__)
model = joblib.load('language_model.pkl')
client = pymongo.MongoClient("mongodb://localhost:27017/")
db = client["songDatabase"]
collection = db["songs"]

@app.route('/upload', methods=['POST'])
def upload():
    file = request.files['file']
    file_path = f"./uploads/{file.filename}"
    file.save(file_path)

    features = extract_features(file_path)
    language = model.predict([features])[0]
    
    # Save song metadata to MongoDB
    collection.insert_one({
        "file_path": file_path,
        "language": language,
        # Add other metadata as needed
    })
    return f"Song uploaded and categorized as {language}"

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)

Frontend Adjustments:

Fetch and display songs based on their categorized language.
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import axios from 'axios';

const LanguageFolders = ({ language }) => {
    const [songs, setSongs] = useState([]);

    useEffect(() => {
        axios.get(`http://localhost:5000/songs?language=${language}`)
            .then(response => setSongs(response.data))
            .catch(error => console.error('Error fetching songs:', error));
    }, [language]);

    return (
        <div>
            <h1>{language} Songs</h1>
            <ul>
                {songs.map(song => (
                    <li key={song._id}>{song.title}</li>
                ))}
            </ul>
        </div>
    );
};

export default LanguageFolders;
